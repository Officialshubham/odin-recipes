                about 10 minutes; remove from heat. Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly
                softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings. </li>
            <li><p align="justify">Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Add
                drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar to flour mixture; whisk until
                batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p align="justify">Combine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; whisk until chile powder is
                completely dissolved.</p> </li>
            <li><p align="justify">Heat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat.
                Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4
